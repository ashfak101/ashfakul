    title: 'üöÄ Why I Chose Next.js for My Portfolio (And Why You Might, Too)',
    description:
      'Discover the benefits of using Next.js for building modern, performant web applications and why it was the perfect choice for my portfolio.',
    date: 'April 15, 2023',
    slug: 'why-nextjs',
    content: `
      In the ever-growing landscape of JavaScript frameworks, Next.js stands out for frontend developers
      who want both performance and productivity. When I rebuilt my portfolio, I made the conscious
      switch from plain React to Next.js‚Äîand here's why that decision paid off.

      üî• 1. Blazing Fast Performance
      Next.js comes with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box.
      My portfolio loads in milliseconds because the pages are pre-rendered and optimized automatically.

      üì¶ 2. File-Based Routing Is a Time-Saver
      No more setting up react-router-dom manually. In Next.js, every file in the pages/ directory
      becomes a route. It saves setup time and keeps routing intuitive.

      üß† 3. SEO Without Hacks
      Since pages are rendered on the server, search engines can easily index my content.
      This is crucial for developers looking to be discovered by recruiters or clients via Google.

      üé® 4. Built-in Image Optimization
      Next.js has its own <Image /> component that automatically optimizes and lazy-loads images.
      Perfect for a visually rich portfolio like mine.

      üß∞ 5. API Routes for Fullstack Capabilities
      You don't need a separate backend to handle contact forms or newsletter subscriptions.
      I've added custom API endpoints directly inside my Next.js app using /pages/api.

      üèÅ Final Thoughts
      If you're a frontend developer aiming to build a fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable portfolio,
      I highly recommend trying out Next.js. It's developer-friendly and gives you all the
      production-level perks out of the box.

      <h2>5 Essential Tools Every Frontend Developer Should Know (2025 Edition)</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>In the ever-evolving world of web development, staying ahead means knowing which tools can streamline your workflow and improve your code quality. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or already deep into your frontend journey, mastering these essential tools can set you apart as a modern developer.</p>

      <p>Here are <strong>5 essential tools every frontend developer should know</strong> in 2025:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs essential:</strong><br />
        VS Code remains the most popular code editor for frontend developers‚Äîand for good reason. With built-in Git support, IntelliSense, terminal access, and a rich library of extensions, it‚Äôs a powerhouse IDE tailored for productivity.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Top extensions to consider:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prettier (for consistent formatting)</li>
        <li>ESLint (for catching errors early)</li>
        <li>Live Server (for real-time preview)</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (if you're using Tailwind)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Chrome DevTools</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs essential:</strong><br />
        Chrome DevTools is the go-to suite for debugging, inspecting, and optimizing websites. From analyzing performance bottlenecks to testing responsive designs, it helps developers understand exactly what‚Äôs going on in the browser.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspect and edit HTML/CSS in real time</li>
        <li>Debug JavaScript with breakpoints</li>
        <li>Monitor network requests and load times</li>
        <li>Simulate mobile devices</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Git & GitHub</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs essential:</strong><br />
        Version control is a must for modern development. Git lets you track changes and collaborate with others, while GitHub serves as your portfolio, collaboration hub, and even CI/CD platform.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code collaboration and pull requests</li>
        <li>Issue tracking and project boards</li>
        <li>Hosting open-source contributions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. NPM (Node Package Manager)</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs essential:</strong><br />
        Almost every frontend project now involves a build step or uses JavaScript libraries. NPM allows you to manage dependencies, run scripts, and integrate tools like Webpack, Vite, or React.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples of packages you‚Äôll likely use:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>React / Vue / Next.js</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
        <li>Axios or Fetch for APIs</li>
        <li>ESLint, Prettier for code quality</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Figma</h2>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs essential:</strong><br />
        Frontend developers don‚Äôt just code‚Äîthey bring designs to life. Figma is a powerful design tool that bridges the gap between designers and developers. It allows you to inspect design specs, grab CSS values, and export assets directly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why developers love Figma:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time collaboration with designers</li>
        <li>Access to measurements, typography, and colors</li>
        <li>Ability to leave comments or clarify design decisions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Mastering these tools won‚Äôt just make your workflow smoother‚Äîit will make you more efficient, confident, and ready to take on any frontend challenge. In 2025, the line between design, code, and deployment is thinner than ever. These five tools are the foundation of a modern, productive frontend stack.</p>

      <p>üîß <strong>Want to level up?</strong> Make sure you‚Äôre also exploring modern frameworks like React or Next.js, and get familiar with CSS tools like Tailwind or SCSS.</p>
